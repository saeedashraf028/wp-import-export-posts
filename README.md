# wp-import-export-posts
Files contain 2 plugins to <b>export</b> and <b>import</b> posts from One WP site to Other in json format. 

<b>Case-Study</b> <br />
Previous days I was facing issue to migrate posts from live website to staging site. <br />
One of my client asked me to create a NEW website cloning existing website with some customizations. <br />
As his previous website was LIVE, so i craeted a clone as staging website. <br />
In that period client have posted 100s of posts to live website which need to be move to Staging website with some extra functionality
related texonomies. <br />
<br />
I first exported all posts in json format ( date filter )
Then imported all in staging website. 

Here i have placed my code, if anyone can get help from it.
