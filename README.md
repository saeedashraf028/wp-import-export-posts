Files contain 2 plugins to #export and #import posts from One WP site to Other in json format. 

#Case-Study
Previous days I was facing issue to migrate posts from live website to staging site.
One of my client asked me to create a NEW website cloning existing website with some customizations.
As his previous website was LIVE, so i craeted a clone as staging website. 
In that period client have posted 100s of posts to live website which need to be move to Staging website with some extra functionality
related texonomies.

I first exported all posts in json format ( date filter )
Then imported all in staging website. 

Here i have placed my code, if anyone can get help from it.
